This document lays out my recommended server setup for a simple server with the db operating on the same machine as the engine. 
These steps are not mandatory to achieve the dependency status laid out on the readme.

1: Start out with the latest CentOS release, a minimal install.
2: Install Mongodb according to these instructions: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat/ Install all packages through the meta-package, you will eventually need them. If mongo isn't started and enabled right after install, use systemctl enable mongod and systemctl start mongod.
3: Clone Node.js source code from https://github.com/nodejs/node.git and checkout the latest tag for the required version on the readme. You can list tags using git tag -l and filter using grep.
4: Run ./configure and them make. You can add -jX where X is the amount of cores yours CPU have if you have more than 1 core available. After compiling, run sudo make install.
5: Enable the epel-release and PowerTools repositories.
6: Install ImageMagick from the package manager.

Optional:
If you wish to either make gifs thumbnails with ffmpeg or make thumbnails of videos and audio files.:
7: Install zlib-devel from the package manager.
8: Clone git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git and checkout the latest tag for the required version on the readme.
9: Compile and install just like node. To be able to build native functions, you must run configure with both --enable-shared and --enable-pic. If you have a previous compilation, run make clean beforehand. Also, don't forget to run ldconfig to register the libraries, like "ldconfig /usr/local/lib". If you are having issues with pkg-config not finding it, use "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig"" and try again.
10: Install ImageMagick-c++-devel from the package manager. This is also required to build the native functions.

If you wish to use sendmail to send e-mails:
11: Install sendmail from the package manager and configure it.

If you wish to validate mimes:
12: Install file from the package manager.

If you wish to strip exif data:
13: Install epel from the package manager and then install perl-Image-ExifTool.

After this you will also have to open the port 25 for smtp, if I am not mistaken, for the sending of e-mails and don't forget the tcp port you wish to provide access through.
Naturally, if you opt to send e-mails through sendmail you won't necessarily need to open port 25/smtp.
